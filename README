Create a .properties file parser

To get more information about the .properties file format, refer to the following link:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties

Implement the interface com.leek.test1.Properties

Implementation should be able to:
* read a file
* ignore the comment lines
* parse its content into keys and values
* return the value for a given key

A test is defined in the directory src/test/java/com/leek/test1/TestProperties.java
You must complete the test and verify that its execution is OK.
